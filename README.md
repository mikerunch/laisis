A public demo for a Local Artificial Intelligence Software Integration System by Michael Mordvinov.

LAISIS (Local Artificial Software Integration System) is a lightweight solution for developers to integrate AI models directly into their software or games — without cloud infrastructure. It includes a small SDK and a user-facing launcher that manages and runs local AI models (like Mistral via Ollama) on the end user’s device.

The goal of LAISIS is to make AI integration effortless, privacy-friendly, and cost-free for developers — shifting the compute and control to the user’s machine. No server costs, no API limits — just fast, offline AI that works out of the box.
